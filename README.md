# xgs landing speed plugin
x-plane xgs landing speed plugin - reloaded

This is a further development of the well known "Landing speed plugin" 
https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/7995-landing-speed-plugin/

The original code contains compiled in limits and text for rating the landing that are not appropriate for airliners.
There are some mods on the net with other compiled in limits.

In addition to the 'old' xgs plugin this version features:

- per aircraft configuration files that are easily editable.
  A sample configuration file for the Airbus A320 family is included.

- Reporting
  - height above threshold
  - touchdown distance from threshold
  - deviation from center line
  
The development is currently in beta status and is tested with X-plane 11 64bit on Windows 10.

The latest binary kit can always be found here: https://github.com/hotbso/xgs/releases
